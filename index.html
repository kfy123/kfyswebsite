                <p>My research and academic journey began during my undergraduate program, where I focused on occupational health and safety, deeply exploring hazard prevention through human behavior analysis. I led a project named 'Optimization Project of Enterprise Occupational Disease,' using the Statistical Analysis System to analyze and predict companies' behaviors, and making policy recommendations. This project earned funding from the Beijing University Students’ Scientific Research and Entrepreneurial Project. My early interest in human factors seamlessly transitioned into my graduate studies in Boston, where my research has consistently focused on the intersection of human behavior prediction and Machine Learning applications.</p>
                <p>After graduating, I began my career as an Algorithm Engineer at Nanjing Fiberhome Technology Co., Ltd., where I spearheaded projects in speech recognition technology. I am a highly motivated researcher, with my work primarily focusing on enhancing algorithmic designs and optimization processes. I was part of the team that achieved second place in the '2021 China Hualu Cup Data Lake Algorithm Competition' with our project 'Multi-channel Speech Recognition.' Additionally, I assist my teammates on projects related to Computer Vision. Besides my technical responsibilities, I also take charge of collecting and managing comprehensive project resources, ensuring our team has robust materials to support our research and development efforts. Due to my company's strict confidentiality agreements, all my coding activities are carried out exclusively on the internal network. Our policy stipulates that any developed code cannot be shared publicly for three years after my departure. As a result, I am unable to showcase my work on GitHub or any other public platform. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
